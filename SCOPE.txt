I have a project that I am working on (you can start from scratch on this one)  where I need a calendar (please use C#, mvc, JQuery)
Here's what it needs to do:
1 - Show a calendar to the user.  The user enters a date, then selects a time slot between 3 hours and 10 hours.
Then they enter their name, email, phone number.  

You save this information to a DB. For each time slot, there are 10 bookings.  
SO After the 10th person books the time, no one else can pick it (show the calendar time as blocked)
Also, is I book 9/1/2017 @ 9:00 am, no one can book 9/1/2017 @ 10:00 (
someone already is using starting 9:00) 
Does this make sens?

no per time slot
3 pm to 6 pm...Max 10 booking?
So, if the first customer picks 9:00-12:00, another can pick either 9:00-12:00 or 12:00 to 3:00
exactly
but if there is a booking for 3:00, we cannot pick 4:00
If there are no bookings for the day, they can pick any time

so the Calendar is for public users?

[23/08/2017 18:02:27] Navaseelan: you need admin section to see the bookings? with login permission

Yes, and if you want you can hard code the user / pwd.
The important part is the Admin View
Tehy have an existing DB for users, that we will integrate in phase 2
Here's an example
